    self-isolation mandates.`,

Starting from the concept of the abject in the form of spit and saliva, I try to think about the boundaries of the Self and the Other, and what comes through them as a cross-contamination of our own subjectivities. The sound was made by recording the foam material seen in the video with binaural microphones. The video was entirely made with a smartphone, by using a screen recorder and manipulating it through touch. It is
    meant to be seen as vertical video on a smartphone and headphones.`,

It raises questions such as: how can we listen to each other without judgement? What is the social potential of failing together instead of winning alone? If singing is a way for words to go through a body, what happens when we read theory as melody?`,

    text: `Abstract\nIn a world moved by communication , listening — a fundamental part of the
            communication process broadly understood as the act of decoding information — is
            something that is alluded to all the time. This research project is a close examination
            on the ways in which listening is instrumentalized in today’s communication-driven
            socio-political climate. Parting from a close analysis of the Panopticon and the
            Panacousticon, we examine the ways in which today’s power mechanisms resemble
            a more aural (as opposed to visual) way of controlling its subjects. By taking a critical
            look at the human-machine communication process and commenting on current
            issues such as the Google assistant eavesdropping scandal, this research explores
            the foundations and socio-political implications of listening algorithms that run apps
            like Shazam and Spotify, or marketing tools like social media listening. Finally, this
            paper stresses the need to better understand the task of listening and its relation to
            the formation of co-subjectivities, and concludes by proposing ways to “muddy up
            the algorithm” in order to resist the instrumentalization and weaponization of the task
            of listening.
