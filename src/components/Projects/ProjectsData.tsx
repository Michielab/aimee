    text: 'We, a group of five, came together because of a mutual interest in sound. We are interested in how we listen and how sound is being used in its own materiality to foster experimental and border-crossing ways of making and thinking. At the end of 2020, we started a small online reading group where each one of us proposed a book they wanted to read. One of them was Sasha Geffen’s book Glitter up the Dark, which explores the intersections of gender, pop culture, the body, and technology. We reached out to Sasha and asked if they would be interested in collaborating with us. The following audio is composed by a mix of excerpts from their book, Sasha’s own voice, songs, samples, and voices from our friends.',

    text: `Somewhere between a silent concert, a performative reading and a live ASMR
    session,this listening experience reflects on the idea of bubble formation as a form of solidarity in a world that is at once globalized and atomized. Through the very intimate and introspective act of listening, this performance is a meditation on the ways in which subjectivity is not only created within, but through coming in contact with other bodies​ —​ ​a process of contamination​—​ref​ lecting on the ambivalence of a time when massive protests in show of solidarity happen at the same time as
    self-isolation mandates.`,
    subText: `Note: This performance was meant to happen at Het Hem but since I couldn’t
    be there after testing positive for covid, this is a version of the live performance I did in my room which was streamed to the audience at Het Hem. The piece is meant to be heard on headphones. This is early low-quality documentation taken with phone cameras as this performance happened recently on Oct 30th and official documentation is pending.`,

The text and the performance are a meditation on the non-synchronicity of a time when human beings aren’t able to keep up with the pace of technological progress. By juxtaposing old and new pieces of technology like metronomes and smartphones, the piece speaks about the ambivalence of the passing of time in a digitally mediated world and the flattening of our experience of Otherness.`,

    text: `Parting from ASMR aesthetics, this experimental video essay dwells on the idea of sound as a material medium and explores the tactility of the sonic. Starting from the concept of the abject in the form of spit and saliva, I try to think about the boundaries of the Self and the Other, and what comes through them as a cross-contamination of our own subjectivities. The sound was made by recording the foam material seen in the video with binaural microphones. The video was entirely made with a smartphone, by using a screen recorder and manipulating it through touch. It is
    meant to be seen as vertical video on a smartphone and headphones.`,

    text: `This project is the outcome of a long term exchange between artist and musician Aimée Theriot and Luca Soudant. It started with sending each other audio snippets, text fragments and objects via post as a form of inquiry and research. The project experiments with karaoke-as-form and investigates failing as a generative force for creating bonds of solidarity. It raises questions such as: how can we listen to each other without judgement? What is the social potential of failing together instead of winning alone? If singing is a way for words to go through a body, what happens when we read theory as melody?`,

    text: 'The idea of this installation is to bring people together in real life experiences, through the use of technological tools and audiovisuals, as a way of generating a shared in situ experience between two strangers. People were invited throughout the course of 6 months to sign up in a website that was put together to “match” strangers based solely on the date and time they picked in a calendar. These people would then visit the installation space in pairs, on a given hour and day and meet the other person for the first time. Then, they would sit facing each other and be connected to biosensors (EEG, skin conductivity and heartbeat). The participants were surrounded by an audiovisual environment that was being created in real time through the data gathered by the biosensors. This was a collaboration with Mexican artist Eduardo Obieta. Supported by the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA).',

The premise of the work is to make invisible processes (like the electromagnetic frequencies of our brain waves) accessible to our senses through the use of technology and to interact with this processes in the form of sound, movement and improvisation. This is a work in progress which will be presented at the National Center for the Arts in Mexico City in August 2018.
