    text: 'The idea of this installation is to bring people together in real life experiences, through the use of technological tools and audiovisuals, as a way of generating a shared in situ experience between two strangers. People were invited throughout the course of 6 months to sign up in a website that was put together to “match” strangers based solely on the date and time they picked in a calendar. These people would then visit the installation space in pairs, on a given hour and day and meet the other person for the first time. Then, they would sit facing each other and be connected to biosensors (EEG, skin conductivity and heartbeat). The participants were surrounded by an audiovisual environment that was being created in real time through the data gathered by the biosensors. This was a collaboration with Mexican artist Eduardo Obieta. Supported by the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA).',

    text: 'The piece combines movement, improvisation and the performer’s reaction to the sounds which are being transformed in real time through the use of an EEG sensor and the algorithmic composition environment SuperCollider. The premise of the work is to make invisible processes (like the electromagnetic frequencies of our brain waves) accessible to our senses through the use of technology and to interact with this processes in the form of sound, movement and improvisation. This is a work in progress which will be presented at the National Center for the Arts in Mexico City in August 2018.

The sound snippets of the poem and the percussion, as well as the channel through which they are played respond to the performer’s Alpha brain waves.',

    text: 'This project was sponsored by No.Estación.Arte, a non profit organization I co-founded and which worked from 2009 - 2014. The aim of this project was to reach out to Mayan communities of the Yucatan peninsula, specifically young kids, and provide after school music programs from a non-colonial perspective, combining the curriculum of classical music with folk music and experimental sound exploration. The program also organized concerts and workshops from national and international artists at the communities. The kids traveled on several occasions to Merida, the capital of the state, where they performed at local venues, and also presented experimental music concerts in their own communities. The recording is a live performance by the children of the town of Tekik de Regil, using their voices and several DIY instruments designed in the classes.',
