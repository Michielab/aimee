    text: 'We, a group of five, came together because of a mutual interest in sound. We are interested in how we listen and how sound is being used in its own materiality to foster experimental and border-crossing ways of making and thinking. At the end of 2020, we started a small online reading group where each one of us proposed a book they wanted to read. One of them was Sasha Geffen’s book Glitter up the Dark, which explores the intersections of gender, pop culture, the body, and technology. We reached out to Sasha and asked if they would be interested in collaborating with us. The following audio is composed by a mix of excerpts from their book, Sasha’s own voice, songs, samples, and voices from our friends.',

    session,this listening experience reflects on the idea of bubble formation as a form of solidarity in a world that is at once globalized and atomized. Through the very intimate and introspective act of listening, this performance is a meditation on the ways in which subjectivity is not only created within, but through coming in contact with other bodies​ —​ ​a process of contamination​—​ref​ lecting on the ambivalence of a time when massive protests in show of solidarity happen at the same time as
    self-isolation mandates.`,

Starting from the concept of the abject in the form of spit and saliva, I try to think about the boundaries of the Self and the Other, and what comes through them as a cross-contamination of our own subjectivities. The sound was made by recording the foam material seen in the video with binaural microphones. The video was entirely made with a smartphone, by using a screen recorder and manipulating it through touch. It is
    meant to be seen as vertical video on a smartphone and headphones.`,

It started with sending each other audio snippets, text fragments and objects via post as a form of inquiry and research. The project experiments with karaoke-as-form and investigates failing as a generative force for creating bonds of solidarity. It raises questions such as: how can we listen to each other without judgement? What is the social potential of failing together instead of winning alone? If singing is a way for words to go through a body, what happens when we read theory as melody?`,

We also held a weekly improvisation session open to anyone which happened uninterrupted for 3 years. During this time, networks and collaborations sparked within a diverse group of artists in the city and from abroad.
